      <p class="mt-6 text-base text-slate-600">
        Steve started Bazen Woodworking in Corsica, South Dakota after a decade in commercial millwork and residential finish carpentry. Today, his shop builds custom cabinetry for kitchens, mudrooms, bathrooms, and specialty spaces across the region.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4 text-base text-slate-600">
        Every project follows the same hands-on process: measure on-site, draft tailored layouts, build in the shop with premium materials, finish in-house, and install with care. No middlemen, no guesswork—just cabinetmaking done right from start to finish.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4 text-base text-slate-600">
        Steve thrives on the details: soft-close hardware that lines up perfectly, color-matched finishes, and installs that wrap up on time. He partners closely with homeowners, builders, and designers, providing status updates at each milestone so you always know what’s next.
